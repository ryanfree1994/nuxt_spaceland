SEO Overview

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) can assist in a site gaining more traffic from users based on certain keywords or meta data throughout the code. The most common SEO strategy is to ensure key words you'd like to generate traffic are embedded in headers from <h1> to <h6>. By combining SEO strategies and Google Analytics, a developer can assist a marketer in where and how users are landing on the website, so that content can be updated to generate more users based on certain keywords a search engine would recognize.

SEO Proposal

In order to improve the SEO of my website, I would ensure Spaceland and other unique terms (i.e., attractions, neptune's water falls) are assigned to headers, as well as the title of each page. I would also add Google Analytics into my site's code and review where people click on most often or explore on the site, so that I can leverage these high-touch areas within my SEO.
